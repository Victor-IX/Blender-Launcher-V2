title: Blender Launcher First-Time Setup

welcome:
  title: Welcome to Blender Launcher %{v}
  text: |
    In this First-Time Setup, we will walk through the most common settings you will likely want to configure.
    you only have to do this once and never again.
    All of these settings can be changed in the future.

library:
  title: Blender Launcher library Location
  subtitle: Make sure that this folder has enough storage to download and store all the builds you want.

  move_exe: Move exe to library
  move_exe_tooltip: Moves the program's exe to the specified location. Once first-time-setup is complete, you'll have to refer to this location in subsequent runs.

  perm_warning:
    Windows: "Warning: Do not use C:/Program Files/... as your library location or anywhere else you may not have permissions"
    Linux: "Warning: Do not use /bin as your library location or anywhere else you may not have permissions"

  location: "Library location:"

  path_warning: The program's exe is outside of %{home}, it may lack the permissions needed to move the executable to the library!

repo_select:
  title: Blender repositories visibility
  subtitle: Enable/disable certain builds of blender to be visible/scraped.

shortcuts:
  title: Shortcuts and file association
  subtitle: Create Blender Launcher shortcuts and register file associations to open .blend files directly with Blender Launcher

  start_menu: Add to Start Menu
  desktop: Add to Desktop

file_association:
  name: Register for file associations
  Linux: |
    In order to launch blendfiles with Blender Launcher on Linux, we will generate a .desktop file at the requested location. \
    It contains mimetype data which tells the desktop environment (DE) what files the program expects to handle, and as a side effect the program is also visible in application launchers.

    Our default location is typically searched by DEs for application entries.
  Windows: |
    In order to launch blendfiles with Blender Launcher on Windows, we will update the registry to relate the launcher to the .blend extension. \
    To reverse this after installation, there is a labeled panel in the Settings general tab. You will find a button to unregister the launcher there.

    Hover over this text to see which registry keys will be changed and for what reason.
  win_reg_key: |
    The Following keys will be changed:
    CREATE Software\Classes\blenderlauncherv2.blend\shell\open\command -- To expose the launcher as a software class
    UPDATE Software\Classes\.blend\OpenWithProgids -- To add the launcher to the .blend "Open With..." list
    CREATE Software\Classes\blenderlauncherv2.blend\DefaultIcon -- To set the icon when Blender Launcher is the default application
    These will be deleted/downgraded when you unregister the launcher

appearance:
  title: Blender Launcher appearance
  subtitle: Configure how Blender Launcher Looks


  titlebar: Use System Titlebar
  titlebar_label: This disables the custom title bar and uses the OS's default titlebar.
  titlebar_label_linux: |
    This disables the custom title bar and uses the OS's default titlebar.

    In Linux Wayland environments, this is recommended because you will be
    able to use the title for moving and resizing the windows.
    Our main method of moving and resizing works best on X11.

  dpi_scaling: |
    This changes the DPI factor of the program.
    automatically scales the user interface based on the monitor's pixel density, multiplied by this value.
    Helps when things are too small to read on screens like MacOS

background:
  title: Running Blender Launcher in the background
  subtitle: Blender Launcher can be kept alive in the background with a system tray icon. This can be useful for reading efficiency and other features, but it is not totally necessary.
  show_tray_icon: Run Blender Launcher in the background (Minimise to tray)

committing:
  title: Committing settings changes...
  subtitle: This should take less than a second.

  finished_page: Finished page "%{page}"

error:
  title: An Error occured during setup!
  continue: Continue anyways?


  occurred: |
    %{finished_pages}
    ERR OCCURED DURING PAGE %{page}!
    %{exc}
