## Why do I need it?

The goal of Blender Launcher is to make it easier to stay up to date with the latest features and improvements of Blender 3D together with the security of stable releases. Since it is a minimalistic portable application, it is a nice tool for organizing the evolving, free, and open source 3D creation suite.

## What features does it have?

Core features:

* Automatic checking for the latest Blender builds.
* Simple Blender build update.
* Quick access to your favorite builds via the tray context menu or by middle clicking on the tray icon.
* Register .blend file extension for your preferred build or the last saved build.
* Startup arguments for launching Blender.
* Template installation.
* Indication of running builds and its number of instances.

Compared to its [predecessor](https://github.com/DotBow/Blender-Version-Manager), Blender Launcher introduces a number of major improvements:

* It's rewritten from the ground up for better stability and extensibility.
* All official builds, as well as popular Blender forks, are available:
    * [Stable releases](https://download.blender.org/release/)
    * [Daily builds](https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/)
    * [Experimental branches](https://builder.blender.org/download/branches/)
    * [Bforartists](https://www.bforartists.de/download/) - UI-focused fork
    * [UPBGE](https://upbge.org/) - Game engine fork (Stable and Weekly builds)
* Version consistent .blend file opening
* Faster starting times by caching data
* Support for high DPI displays
* And many new quality of life features!
