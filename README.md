## What is Blender Launcher?

Blender Launcher is a standalone software client that provides management for stable, daily and experimental builds of [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/). It is a free open source project available for 64-bit Windows and Linux (GLIBC 2.31 and higher) operating systems.

The goal of Blender Launcher is to make it easier to stay up to date with the latest features and improvements of Blender 3D together with the security of stable releases.
